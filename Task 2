2. Analyzing Phishing Characteristics
Phishing Trait	Details in Email
Sender Spoofing	The email claims to be from PayPal, but the domain (pay-pal-secure.com) is not a legitimate PayPal domain.
Urgency & Fear Tactics	The email states that my account will be permanently blocked if I don’t respond within 24 hours.
Suspicious Links	A button labeled “Verify Now” leads to http://verify-login-paypal.com, which is not an official PayPal website.
Grammar & Spelling Errors	"Your account has been suspand due to unusuals activities."
Fake Branding & Logo	The PayPal logo in the email appears blurry, indicating possible image manipulation.
Mismatched URLs	Hovering over the “Verify Now” link shows a different URL than the one displayed in the text.
3. Email Header Analysis
Using an Email Header Analyzer, I discovered: ✔ The Return-Path differs from PayPal’s domain. ✔ The Received SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record does not match PayPal’s mail servers. ✔ The DKIM signature is missing, which is unusual for legitimate business emails.

4. Conclusion & Security Recommendations
✅ This email is a phishing attempt designed to steal PayPal login credentials. ✅ If received, DO NOT click on any links or attachments. ✅ Report & delete the email immediately using PayPal’s official fraud report system. ✅ Always verify sender details & email authenticity before taking action.
